# Heat-Disease_Classification
# Heart Disease Prediction - Machine Learning Model

This project implements an end-to-end machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease based on clinical data. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and feature importance.

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included
- `end-to-end-heart-disease-classification.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire workflow.
- `heart_disease.csv`: Dataset used for training and testing.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python libraries required to run the project.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset contains patient health metrics like:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Blood pressure
- Cholesterol
- Blood sugar
- ECG results
- Heart rate
- Exercise-induced angina
- And others...

The target variable indicates the presence of heart disease.
